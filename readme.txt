Author Tweets widget fetches, caches and displays the N most recent tweets by an author.

== Description ==

Show your author's tweets on your blog sidebar. They are parsed and formatted so hashtags, usernames and links are links.

You can select to show their tweets on either or both the post page and author archive page.

You can set how many tweets to show. It fetches that number for display.

Don't worry about caching. We take care of it.

Don't worry about setting up a twitter account field in the author profile edit form; we took care of it.

You may want to worry about how the tweets display. See the sample css in this plugin's directory.

Check out the screen shots. But once you activate and add it to your sidebar in wp-admin, you'll see it's pretty intuitive.

== Installation ==

Upload the Author Tweets Plugin to your blog, and Activate it.
